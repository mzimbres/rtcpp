Some motivation for the coding standards

Simplicity
==========

* Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
  (Leonardo da Vinci)

* Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
  (Dijkstra)

* The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity.
  (Hoare)

* The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get
  confused by the complexities of his own making.
  (Dijkstra)

* Controlling complexity is the essence of computer
  programming.
  (Brian Kernighan)

* The central enemy of reliability is complexity.
  (Geer et al.)

* Simplicity carried to the extreme becomes elegance.
  (Jon Franklin)

* Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity
  does.  
  (Larry Bossidy)

* Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as
  sophistication, which is baffling—the incomprehensible should
  cause suspicion rather than admiration.  
  (Niklaus Wirth)

Object oientation
=============================

* Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.
  (Rob Pike)

* Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could
  only have originated in California.
  (Edsger Dijkstra)

* The phrase "object-oriented” means a lot of things. Half are
  obvious, and the other half are mistakes.
  (Paul Graham)

* Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a
  method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function.
  (John Carmack)

* And, at least in it’s most popular forms, it can be extremely
  harmful and dramatically increase complexity.

* State is the root of all evil. In particular functions with side
  effects should be avoided.
  (Joe Armstrong)

* The object-oriented model makes it easy to build up programs
  by accretion. What this often means, in practice, is that it
  provides a structured way to write spaghetti code.
  (Paul Graham)

* I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad
  programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or
  his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about
  the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and
  their relationships.
  (Linus Torvalds)

Coding Standards
=============================

* Use two spaces for indentation. Tabs are not allowed.
* Do not end a line with spaces.
* All files must end with a newline.
* Limit line length to 79 characters.
* Avoid use multiple inheritance.
* Avoid use non-public inheritance.
* Avoid object oriented programming.
* Avoid RTTI.
* Avoid dynamic memory allocations for small blocks of memory.
* Separate class declaration from its definition even on class templates.
* Use standard c++ naming convention.
* Keep names short and do use abbreviations.
* Avoid global variables.
* Prefer non-member functions.

Classes
=============================
  
  Braces

    class foo { // Open braces in the same line you declare the class.
    ...
    };

    class foo {
      private: // put the private here, do not omit it.
      int a;
    };

  Commenting Right:

    class foo {
      private:
      int v; // velocity.
      int k; // Keep it one line, long descriptions go elsewhere.
    };

  Commenting Wrong:

    class foo {
      private:
      /*
       * This is the wrong way.
       */
      int d;

      /*
       * Wastes space.
       */
      int v;
    };

Initializer list.
=============================

 - Use the right data member ordering, otherwise compilers raises annoying
   warnings and you are doing something wrong.

 - Indentation is done this way:
   
     foo::foo(int a, int b, int c)
     : data1(a)
     , data1(b)
     , data2(c)
     {}

Functions
=============================

  Different from classes, we do not open braces in the same line.

    void function()
    {
      // code
    }

  There is no space between function names and ():

    function(); // <=== rigth
    function (); // <=== wrong

  Mind the spaces between arguments:

    foo(a, b, c, e); // Right.
    foo(a,b,c,e); // Wrong.

  The same reasoning applies to templates:

    std::pair<double, double> foo; // Right.
    std::pair<double,double> foo; // Wrong.

if - else
=============================

  One line if's do not get braces:

    if (condition)
      do_something();
    else
      another_thing();

  If you need to open braces for one "if", then all get braces too.

    if (condition) {
      one();
      two();
    } else if (condition2) {
      three();
    } else {
      four();
    }

  There is a space between if and ():

  if (condition) // right
  if(condition) // wrong
  

for, while, do - while 
=============================

You usually do not need this in modern C++, but if you do.

  for (condition) // right
  for(condition)  // wrong

  for (condition) { // right
  }

  for (condition) // wrong
  {
  }

  The same reasoning above applies for while loops.

  If you need an infinite loop, use

  for (;;) { // right
  }

  while (1) { // wrong
  }

  Prefer for loops over while loops when you have a counter, this way you do
  not have to add the counter in function scope:

  Right:
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) // i scope is restricted to the for loop.
      do_something();

  Wrong:
    int i = 0; // i is in the outer scope
    while (i < 10) {
      do_something();
      ++i;
    }

Pointers
=============================

You usually do not need this in modern C++, but if you do.

    int* a = 0;

    if (a) // right

    if (a != 0) // wrong

    if (a != NULL) // wrong

  But if a is not a pointer or a boolean variable prefer

    if (a == value) // It makes sense for the reader to know the value.

POD (Plain Old Data)
=============================

  POD data types are initialized this way:

    double i = 0; // Right
    double i(0); // Wrong, uses more characters and is not easier to read.

Equations:
=============================

  Use space with "*" "/" etc:

    const double a = b * c / std::pow(d, e); // Right
    const double a = b*c/std::pow(d,e); // Wrong

From the kernel coding style:
=============================

  Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
  notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can
  check those, and it only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft
  makes buggy programs.

  LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point.  If you have
  some random integer loop counter, it should probably be called "i".
  Calling it "loop_counter" is non-productive, if there is no chance of it
  being mis-understood.  Similarly, "tmp" can be just about any type of
  variable that is used to hold a temporary value.

From fftw coding style:
=============================

  " NAMES: keep them short.  Shorter than you think.  The Bible was written
  without vowels.  Don't outsmart the Bible. 

  Leave that hungarian crap to MS.

Getters and Setters:
=============================

  Getters and setters are sometimes a (big) waste of time and can also
  hide bad program design.

  For example:

    class foo {
      private:
      int m_a;
      public:
      void set(int a) {m_a = a;}
      int get() const {return m_a;}
    };

  is generaly not better than

    struct foo {
      int a;
    };

  The advantages of the later are:
  1 - It uses 3 lines of code instead of 7.
  2 - It does not pretend variable a is encapsulated.

  Now some people would argue that it is easier to add code to check inside
  setter, but fail to say that such changes can break the contract assumed by
  the programmer when he used it and the code has to be reviewed anyway.  The
  lesson is to make variables private if they are really encapsulated.
  Otherwise, make it public and evolve the design.


State:
=============================

  Write stateless code as much as possible, adhere to the principles of
  functional programming when possible. Most important thing are:

  Use pure functions and functors with no state. Multi-threaded programming
  becomes a lot easier this way.
